Weekly data was converted to monthly data.

Features used: Year, Month, Country Name, Product ID, no. of holidays, no. of working days, Expense.

'Expense' came out to be the most important feature.

Training data set was divided into subsets for each unique combination of Country Name and Product ID, and then models were build on these sets seperately. This was done because sales price was in local currency.
